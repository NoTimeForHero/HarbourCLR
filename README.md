Work in Progress:
* Static library for CLR support (with HB_FUNCs like __CLR_INIT)
* Unit-testing

TODO:
* Write normal README.md
* Realize cleanup (with hb_retptrGC?)
* Check is it ok to free HB_errInternal const char * message after call
* Callbacks (with additional C# assembly for normal syntax?)
